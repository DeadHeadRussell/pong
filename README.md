This is a pong clone I made in Win32 / OpenGL when I was self-teaching myself these technologies.

Build and Running
====

Thie project depends on the following:
    Windows
    OpenGL
    MinGW

To compile and run, do the following (assuming MinGW was added to your path)
    cd <pong_directory>
    make
    ./Pong.exe

Undocumented Keybindings
====

In all my UX brilliance, I decided not to document some features of this game.  To switch between single player and two player mode, press `1` for single player and `2` for two players.
In 2 players, the mouse is not supported.  The keys for player one are `left shift: up`, `left ctrl: down`, `s: fast`.  The keys for player two are `up arrow: up`, `down arrow: down`, `p: fast`.
