pong

Pong clone in Win32 / OpenGL

Build and Running
====

This project requires MinGW to build and run. Once MinGW is setup, simply run `make` in the root folder of the project. This will produce the executable file in the same folder.

Undocumented Keybindings
====

In all my brilliance, I decided not to document some features of this game.  To switch between single player and two player games, press `1` for single player and `2` for two players.
In 2 players, the mouse is not supported.  The keys for player one are `left shift: up`, `left ctrl: down`, `s: fast`.  The keys for player two are `up arrow: up`, `down arrow: down`, `p: fast`.
